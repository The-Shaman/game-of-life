# The Game of Life
The Game of Life by John Conway, made in Python.

This was my first self-guided programming project that I chose (that didn't come out of a book), and therefore I was mostly self-guided in this. 
I think it was really exciting to work on this but I don't think I will revisit this project, but if I do, it will probably be in a much more
efficient language.
